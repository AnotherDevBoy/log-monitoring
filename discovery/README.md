# Technical Discovery
The goal of this document is to encapsulate the reasoning behind the solution and the different options considered.

## How to read this document?
The document will be structured in 3 sections:
* **Product requirements**. This section will capture my requirements analysis, the assumptions made based on the wording and the core problems identified.. 
* **Discovery**. Once the requirements are clear, I have captured in this section my research in order to inform the different solutions to explore.
* **Proposal**. Finally, once the requirements are clear and I have a good understanding of the domain, I will break down a few solutions and include the trade-offs identified.
